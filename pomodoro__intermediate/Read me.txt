The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo 
in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, 
traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is 
known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped 
kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

This technique works as follow


	1. Work for 25 minutes
	2. Break for 5 minutes

	3. Work for 25 minutes
	4. Break for 5 minutes

	5. Work for 25 minutes
	6. Break for 5 minutes

	7. Work for 25 minutes
	8. BREAK for 20 minutes

And in this way keep repeating the cycle for as long as required. Later researchers 
suggusted that Pomodoro technique is the best way to utilize brain efficiently.

This script of code will send to your specified email address when the ISS(international space satellite)
passes over the specified location(longitude, latitude) head in the night. In order to recieve the email,
the code has to run for a longer period of time because it compares the position of ISS in the space, which 
is alwasys moving at around 28000km/h, with your position. ISS can be seen in the night that is why whenever
it passes right above you, the script makes sure that its dark before sending an email to look above.
